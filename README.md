## ACPI

This is an acpi client for Linux, originally written by Grahame Bowland 
and. Copyright (C) 2001 Grahame Bowland. Please see the manpage 
for details; INSTALL for installation info.

I took over and moved the package to sourceforge in 2008. The new address is
acpiclient.sourceforge.net.

Debian packages of this software are currently available. It should 
be possible to run "apt-get install acpi" and have a recent version 
installed. The same holds for other distributions of course.

Please send bug reports, requests for features, etc to
meskes@debian.org. If there is a bug in the output of "acpi", 
please include a tar file of /proc/acpi or /sys/class depending on the
interface you used. This will allow me to test the behaviour of the program.
